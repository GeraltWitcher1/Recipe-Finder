# Recipe Finder
As an avid food enthusiast, I often go out of my way to try and find new recipes online to experiment with. 
Unfortunately, more often than not that experience is soured by countless advertisements and the need for the author to share their life story before getting to the actual recipe. 

My app will provide an easy way to look up recipes without getting bombarded with unnecessary information and make homecooks' life a little bit easier.
